# Thread

A thread is a sequence of text content, potentially by different users, and typically representing an online discussion.

Threads can often accompany other sources, such as one or more comment threads on a publication.

Each subsequent reply in a thread is itself capable of being a thread.

Examples of threads include Twitter replies, Reddit comments, or comments on a YouTube video.
